In a world where the impact of carbon emissions looms large, finding ways to minimize our carbon footprints is essential. Inspired by the urgent need to address this global challenge, I among four teammates built EcoTrip - a revolutionary web app designed to guide people towards sustainable living and travel.

At its core, EcoTrip is driven by a singular mission: to recommend eco-friendly options for travelers worldwide. Our app empowers individuals to make conscious choices by providing valuable information on sustainable travel alternatives. Say farewell to mindless consumption of fossil fuels and embrace a greener way to explore the world.

With EcoTrip, discovering a wealth of sustainable travel options becomes effortless. Searching for accommodations that align with your eco-conscious values? Our app allows you to easily find green hotels within a specific vicinity or anywhere in the world. Feel confident in your choice, knowing that you're supporting establishments that prioritize sustainability.

But EcoTrip goes beyond just recommending accommodations. By incorporating real-time data and cutting-edge technology, we provide you with precise information. Curious about the carbon emissions associated with a bus ride between two locations? Our integration with the Google Map API enables us to calculate and present the exact amount of CO2 emitted during the journey. Armed with this knowledge, you can make informed decisions and take steps towards reducing your environmental impact.

EcoTrip is more than just a travel app; it's a transformative tool that empowers individuals to make a difference. By choosing eco-friendly options and minimizing your carbon footprint, you become part of a global movement towards a more sustainable future.

## 🖌️ How We Built EcoTrip?
We started by creating a basic prototype of the web app in React, sketching out the initial design on a whiteboard. We then carefully identified and prioritized the implementable and feasible features. Our focus shifted to building the back end, which involved connecting the searched city for buses and hotels to the Google Map API. After ensuring the functionality of the back end, we proceeded to develop the front end, utilizing React, HTML, and CSS to create visually appealing and user-friendly pages.

## ➕ What's Next for EcoTrip?
While developing EcoTrip, we recognized a limitation in the available travel options for users to search for eco-friendly transportation. Currently, only bus journeys are considered in calculating the amount of CO2 that can be saved. In the future, we aim to expand the options to include cars, electric scooters, trains, and more, providing users with a comprehensive view of emitted CO2 for different modes of transportation. Additionally, we plan to transition from simply accessing API data to storing relevant information in databases, enabling even more advanced features and personalized recommendations for users.
